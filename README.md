#### Development

It's necessary to incorporate histogram loss function to quantify gaussian space change with results change. GAN requries a more precise loss function characterization.

It's necessary to test connectivity reconstruction loss in multi-modal way: euler characteristics, porosity, pore size etc.

It's necessary to classify porosity into different categories

It's necessary to add two point correlation for conditional process. The reason to do so is because we can perserve a general connectivity function
